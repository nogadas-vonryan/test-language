# test-language

---

A simple recursive descent (LL1) interpreter for a weird language. You can mess around with it [here](https://vrcxz.github.io/test-language/). Supports parsing of basic mathematical expressions (PMDAS), relation and logical operators. 

Example code [here](https://github.com/vrcxz/test-language/blob/main/guessing_game.weird).
